# Le-Net-Implmentations
This repository is a part of the Deep Learning Course at NITK. The repository contains the Numpy and TensorFlow implementations of the LeNet<br/>
The base paper for the LeNet architecture can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf)

# Library Dependencies
numpy<br/>
scipy<br/>
matplotlib<br/>
cv2<br/>
tensorflow 2.0<br/>
tqdm<br/>
sklearn

# Authors
Anirudh B H (16EC105)<br/>

# Files
There are 3 Jupyter Notebooks with the implmentations

1) Testing_Convolutions : A notebook with the output of the forward propagation of various convolutional networks
2) LeNet_Numpy : A notebook with the Numpy implementation of the LeNet architecture for the MNIST dataset
3) LeNet_TensorFlow : A notebook with the TensorFlow implementation of the LeNet architecture for the MNIST dataset

# Credit
Our CNN forward and backprop implementations are based on the assignments from the CNNs course<br/> 
This course is part of the deeplearning.ai specialization taught by Andrew NG.<br/>
